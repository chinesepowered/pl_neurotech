Challenge Overview
The future of AI belongs to agents that operate autonomously, coordinate trustlessly, and sustain themselves economically without centralized control. Filecoin is sponsoring challenges that build the foundational infrastructure to make this vision real. These bounties focus on enabling agents to independently manage data on Filecoin, establish verifiable identities and reputations, coordinate securely with other agents, and participate in real economic systems. Developers will create the core primitives that allow AI agents to store state, broker storage deals, monetize datasets, and sustain themselves under actual cost constraints. By anchoring agent operations on Filecoin's decentralized network, these challenges establish the building blocks for a new paradigm where autonomous agents discover, trust, and transact at scale.


Ideas


1. Agent Storage SDK

Challenge Overview



Build a framework-agnostic SDK that enables AI agents to autonomously store, retrieve, and manage data on Filecoin via FOC without human intervention. Bounty Description Minimal agent storage interface (store, retrieve, renew, prune) Agent-usable wallet abstraction with cross-chain funding Default storage policies (cost, redundancy, TTL) Deployment on calibnet (mainnet bonus) with integration docs



2. Onchain Agent Registry 

Challenge Overview



Deploy AI agents as first-class onchain entities with persistent metadata, state, and logs stored on Filecoin, enabling large-scale discovery and coordination. Bounty Description Ethereum-based registry contracts Filecoin-backed metadata, state, and execution logs Multi-agent coordination demo Explorer/dashboard visualizing agents and storage activity



 3. Agent Reputation & Portable Identity 

Challenge Overview



Design a tamper-resistant, portable identity system where agent reputation is derived from verifiable history anchored on Filecoin. Bounty Description CID-rooted identity objects stored on Filecoin Reputation scoring from historical data Proof-of-history demo Cross-environment identity portability + verifier tooling



4. Autonomous Agent Economy 

Challenge Overview

Create a live onchain economic environment where AI agents operate under real cost constraints and must sustain themselves. Bounty Description Onchain budget and fee rules Filecoin-backed agent state Live agent cohort under real economic limits Transparent dashboard + post-mortem analysis



5. Fee-Gated Agent Communication 

Challenge Overview



Build a secure, peer-to-peer messaging protocol for AI agents with onchain fee enforcement and Filecoin-backed message archives. Bounty Description Encrypted P2P agent messaging Onchain fee/staking mechanism Filecoin-backed message persistence Live demo with spam-resistance experiment



6. Autonomous Infrastructure Brokerage

Challenge Overview



Develop broker agents that autonomously evaluate, negotiate, and manage Filecoin storage deals for other agents. Bounty Description Storage deal comparison + recommendation engine Automated deal creation and migration Onchain commission/fee model Metrics dashboard (deals, savings, retention)



7. Agent-Generated Data Marketplace 

Challenge Overview



Build a marketplace where AI agents generate, price, and sell Filecoin-backed datasets with verifiable provenance and onchain settlement. Bounty Description Marketplace contracts (listing, escrow, settlement) CID-rooted dataset storage Producer + consumer agent demo Revenue and transaction dashboard
